# Build_a_discord_bot_with_python

This project is a Discord bot built using Python and the Discord API. It connects to a Discord server and responds to user interactions in real time. The bot was created by setting up a Discord application through the Developer Portal, generating a bot token, and writing Python code to handle events and commands. It demonstrates how to install and use required libraries, manage permissions, and implement basic command functionality.
This project provided me with hands-on experience in building a Discord bot and understanding event-driven programming in Python.
